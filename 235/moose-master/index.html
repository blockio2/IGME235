            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Moose Master sets up in seconds, is easy to learn, and fun for everyone. Start the game by choosing 2 Moose Rules that everyone must follow. 
                <em>(Ex: You can't say the word “no” and you can't refer to anyone by their first name.)</em> Draw a card and follow the instructions. 
                Start a story, rhyme a word, test your memory, name a celebrity, point left, answer a question with a question, and many more. [...]

            <blockquote>
                <q>There are always some rules active on the table that get switched out and replaced as the game progresses, 
                but you will notice you keep trying to follow rules that are no longer in play in fear of getting a penalty.</q>
